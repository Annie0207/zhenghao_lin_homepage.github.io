          Prior to enrolling in Northeastern University Computer Science
          program, I majored in Electronic Science and Technology. While I am
          interested in MCU and MPU, I found that nowadays, with modularized
          hardware like Raspberry Pi, many things can be completed without
          advanced knowledge of hardware. Therefore, I decided to transfer to
          Computer Science and found an internship as a software engineer at
          Fuji Xerox. As an EE student, I learned C language and assembly
          language well, so it's not hard for me to transfer.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-normal">
          In my previous job, I have programmed in C and C++. In my MSCS
          program, I have programmed in python, Java, and C. And the final
          project of my undergraduate study were about Keras and computer
          vision.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-normal">
          I am a responsible and empathic person who can work in a group. And I
          enjoy working with other people. That is why I was asked to be
          re-employed for a short time to help my previous leader for a peak
          time.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-normal">
          I have experience in hardware, machine learning, and Windows
          development. In conjunction with the skills I am developing in my MSCS
          program, I believe my experience will make me a fit for roles as any
          kind of software engineer.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-normal">
          My current goal is to find an internship as a full-stack engineer.
          Feel free to get in touch.
